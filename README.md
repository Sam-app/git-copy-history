# Git Sync History
And only the history

Example: your repo is not on GitHub so for others it looks like you've just stopped coding at all.
So this CLI takes all of YOUR commits from your local repo and commits only hashes of hashes for exact same time to another repo.
Which can be shared on Github without any restrictions.
